# Airport Efficiency Analysis Final Project

## Overview: 
For our project we are looking at the efficiency of local DMV Airports for outbound domestic flights. Specifically we will be pulling data across Baltimore Washington International(BWI), Dules International Airport(IAD), Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport(DCA) from January 2019 through March 2022. Our group will be using the following data points to determine the best run airport: 

* Month/Year/Day of week
* Operating airline
* Airport
* Destination
     * NorthEast, SouthEast, MidWest, SouthWest, West
* Scheduled Take Off Time
* Weather
* Actual Departure

## Reasoning For Our Project: 
As we approach post-pandemic normalcy, we can agree that a vacation (for whatever reason) is long overdue. Making up for lost time, especially while traveling, is something truly important to us. Working with our large dataset is also allowing us to use what we've learned thoughout our class to practice real world situations.

## Data Source: 

We worked with a couple websites to pull data for our project. We filtered through the raw data to grab specific inputs for our analysis.

## Questions We Hope To Answer: 
Our main question -which Airport has been most efficient through the volatility of the past 3 years? That being said, we will be looking at what factors make up the answer. 

* What month/day of the week is the best?
* Does month/day of the week matter? 
* Which airlines preformed the best? 
* How often does weather effect delays? 
* Does Destination effect travel efficiency?
